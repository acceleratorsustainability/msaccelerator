# Microsoft Sustainability Manager Accelerator for SAS Viya

## Description

The Microsoft Sustainability Manager Accelerator for SAS Viya (MSMA) is
a set of objects built on top of SAS Viya that complements the
functionality that is available in Microsoft Sustainability Manager.

The MSMA uses SAS Viya to access the data model of MSM, it enriches the
data and provides a graphical user-friendly interface, based on a
low-code/no-code platform to deliver advanced analytics. With MSMA users
will be able to explore the present and predict and anticipate the
future by the means of easy-to-use advanced forecasting and
scenario-analysis techniques.

MSMA offers:

 Direct access to MSM's data model stored in Microsoft Dataverse

-   A framework to add new data to enrich the current model. While MSM's
    data model provides all the data that are required to provide
    calculations of the model it does not provide with data that might
    be indirect related to emissions, such as weather conditions, sales,
    demand forecasting and economic conditions.

-   A user-friendly environment where CO2e emissions can be explored
    across different dimensions

-   A user friendly-environment where CO2e emissions can be forecasted,
    and different scenario-analysis techniques can be used to anticipate
    future results
